## Runtime

- Write code in JavaScript.
- Target the Machbase Neo JSH runtime, not plain Node.js. JSH is only partially Node.js-compatible.
- Prefer JSH built-in modules and documented APIs before adding third-party packages.
- JSH introduction: https://docs.machbase.com/neo/jsh/index.md
- To run a `.js` file manually, use `machbase-neo jsh <file.js>`.
- The location of the `machbase-neo` executable varies by environment, so always ask the user for its path before requesting or attempting local execution.

## Code Conventions

- Follow the existing CommonJS style with `require(...)`.
- Prefer JSH-compatible APIs and output patterns already used in the workspace, such as `console.println()`.
- Avoid Node.js-only features unless the JSH documentation confirms compatibility.
- Prefer to use `console.print()` and `console.println()` over `console.log()`, `console.error()`.
- When adding comments, prefer intent, expected outcome, policy constraints, and operational cautions over restating mechanics.
- For compatibility layers, transport-specific branches, restart/recovery logic, or other policy-heavy code, leave short comments that explain why the branch exists and what must not be broken when it is changed.

## Build And Validation

- There is no standard automated test command defined in `package.json`.
- When validation is needed, prefer the smallest relevant JSH execution command after confirming the `machbase-neo` executable path with the user.

## Service Notes

- When a Machbase Neo package manages long-running jobs, prefer the JSH `service` module over ad hoc background process handling.
- Treat config files, service registration, pid files, and checkpoint/state files as separate lifecycle artifacts. Decide explicitly which ones are created, preserved, or removed for create, update, recover, overwrite, and delete flows.
- Do not assume `service install` will launch commands the same way as a shell. Verify whether the target environment expects a script path or a command wrapper before registering services.
- When updating config for a running service, prefer explicit restart semantics. Only restart automatically if the product behavior requires applying changes immediately.
- For list APIs, distinguish between "config exists" and "service is actually installed". Returning every config file as an installed job is usually misleading.
- For delete/reset flows, decide whether logs are retained separately from config, pid, and checkpoint cleanup.
- Direct JSH validation of service-aware CGI scripts may require mounted paths such as `/public` or `/etc`, and service-control flows may also require `SERVICE_CONTROLLER`.

## Packages And package.json

- Package documentation: https://docs.machbase.com/neo/jsh/packages.md
- Keep package usage compatible with JSH package behavior.

## Global APIs

- JSH globals such as `console`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `setImmediate` are documented here: https://docs.machbase.com/neo/jsh/global.md

## Module System

- JSH module system: https://docs.machbase.com/neo/jsh/modules/index.md
